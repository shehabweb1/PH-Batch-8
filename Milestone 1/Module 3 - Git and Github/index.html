        <p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a GitHub repository and push files to it:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a GitHub Account:
                If you don't already have a GitHub account, go to <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> and sign up
                for a new account.
                Follow the instructions to complete the registration process.</li>
            <li>Create a New Repository:
                Once you're logged in to GitHub, click on the "+" icon at the top-right corner of the page and select
                "New repository" from the dropdown menu.</li>
            <li>Fill in Repository Details:
                On the new repository page, provide a name for your repository. Choose a descriptive name that reflects
                the purpose of your project. You can also add an optional description, choose whether the repository
                should be public or private, and initialize it with a README file (recommended).</li>
            <li>Initialize Local Git Repository:
                If you haven't done so already, initialize a local Git repository on your computer. Open a terminal or
                command prompt in the desired directory and run the following command: git init</li>
            <li>Add Files to the Repository:
                Copy or create the files you want to add to the repository in the local directory. Use the following
                command to add all files to the staging area: git add .
            </li>
            <li>Commit the Changes:
                Commit the changes to your local repository with a descriptive message. Use the following command: git
                commit -m "Initial commit"
            </li>
            <li>Connect Local and Remote Repositories:
                On the repository page on GitHub, copy the remote repository URL. In your terminal or command prompt,
                add the remote repository by running the following command: git remote add origin
                <remote_repository_url>
            </li>
            <li>Push the Commits:
                Finally, push the commits from your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub using the
                following command: git push -u origin master
            </li>
            <li>Provide GitHub Credentials:
                When prompted, enter your GitHub username and password (or personal access token) to authenticate and
                push the changes to the remote repository.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>That's it! Your files should now be pushed to the GitHub repository. You can go to the repository page on
            GitHub to verify the changes and collaborate with others.</p>
